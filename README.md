=============

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/em6rtw0cj5lre0k4?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tsimafei-markhel/fireworks)

Fireworks.NET is a .NET implementation of [Fireworks Algorithm for Optimization](http://www.cil.pku.edu.cn/research/fa/) (FWA) and its variations.

###Project Purpose
This project is aimed at creating a set of .NET "building blocks" for FWA - and build some variations of FWA from these "blocks".

All rights for the algorithms belong to their respective authors.

###Intended Audience
* .NET developers interested in Optimization algorithms.
* Researchers seeking for .NET implementation of FWA that can be used in other projects.

###Reference
Implementation is based on the following papers that can be found by the [link](http://www.cil.pku.edu.cn/publications/):
* Ying Tan, Yuanchun Zhu, "Fireworks Algorithms for Optimization", Proc. of International Conference on Swarm Intelligence (ICSIâ€™2010), June 12-15, Beijing, China, 2010. ICSI 2010, Part II, LNCS 6145, pp.355-364, 2010. Springer-Verlag, 2010. - Referred in code as **2010 paper**.
* (Items to be added to this list as new implementations appear.)
