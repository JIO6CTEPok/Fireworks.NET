Coding Guidelines
================

- Spaces, not tabs. Tab indent = 4 spaces.
- Always use ```this``` keyword to access instance members.
- Do not add new line in the end of file.
- Keep ```using <Namespace>;``` outside of namespace block.
- ```using <Namespace>;``` ordering: first System, then 3<sup>rd</sup>-party, then everything else. Maintain alphabetic ascending order inside these groups.
- Use C# native types instead of CTS types (e.g. ```int``` instead of ```Int32```).
- Provide meaningful XML comments for all (at least public) types and members.
